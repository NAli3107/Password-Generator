# Password-Generator

Overview:

This application enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. This application has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Functionality:

When a user clicks the button to generate a password they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. At this point, they are able to select which criteria to include in the password and are reminded, with a prompt, that the length of the password must be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. 

Users are then asked for character types to include in the password. These character types include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. Upon answering each prompt, then a user's input is validated and at least one character type is selected. Finally, once all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and is displayed (written) onto the page. 

What to Expect:
